            On Tuesday June 25, 2024, Interface Friends will have a venue right next to the Moscone Center
            that allows you to connect together in San Francisco one day before Figma’s Config conference
            begins with 200-300 other designers.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’ll get to hang out, meet new friends, listen and participate in design career related talks by
            special guests, and other fun activities that provide opportunities to network with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to get you connected so you can experience the rest of the week at Config together,
            with friends. Long lasting friends.
